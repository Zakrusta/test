### *Exercise 2*

1. Create a new branch called add-readme

2. On this branch, create a Markdown file called "README.md" (you can use the same Markdown syntax that you use in notebook Markdown cells). Add a few lines to this file, telling users what is in your repository. 

3. Add and commit this file, and then merge it into your master branch.
    - Note that after you've commited the new file on the add-readme branch, when you checkout your "master" branch again, it'll look like the README.md file has disappeared. However, it'll reappear after the branch has been merged.
